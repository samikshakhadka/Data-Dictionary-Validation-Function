Create a generic function for validating a dictionary. 
This function should take a dictionary and validation rules as arguments.
The purpose is to validate various fields in the dictionary, such as strings with min/max length, numbers with min/max values, booleans with true/false values, and so on.
The function should return True if all fields in the dictionary pass the validation based on the provided rules; otherwise, it should return False.
